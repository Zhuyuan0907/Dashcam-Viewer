# Changelog

## 2.1.1 — 2026-09-13

- Coordinate front/rear buffering through one shared playback controller across trip viewing,
  editor preview and anonymous sharing. Both cameras wait when required footage buffers, then
  resume together. Manual pause remains authoritative while the network recovers.
- Show which camera is buffering; exclude missing footage and already-ended companion streams
  from the wait barrier. Camera swaps preserve capture time across unequal camera timelines.
- Stop chasing a moving playback clock while a camera seeks, surface playback failures instead
  of swallowing them, and clean up listeners/pending playback when a shared player is replaced.
- Add deterministic playback-state regressions and real delayed-media-response browser tests.
  Remove the superseded seek-only synchronizer and document the maintainer's commit/push/deploy
  completion requirement in AGENTS.md.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-12

Seven sequential implementation stages focus on open-source self-hosting.

- Recoverable editing: journaled media replacement, fractional offsets, immutable clip source
  timestamps, gap-aware camera timelines and verified output duration.
- Owner-scoped background history, bounded queues, cancellation and explicit interrupted-job retry.
- Resumable 4 MiB uploads with persisted manifests, optional chunk SHA-256, disk reservations and
  automatic complete-batch handoff. Transfers still require an open browser until server acceptance.
- Mobile and keyboard editing, local drafts, timeline zoom and three shared semantic palettes.
- Generic MP4/MOV/TS naming, rear-only recordings, content-based duplicate detection, clip search,
  pagination, rename and report drafts.
- Non-root Compose deployment, diagnostics, offline verified full-data backups and restore refusal
  on existing or relocated destinations.
- Integration hardening: stale-edit rejection, camera stream compatibility, collision-safe output
  directories, bounded probe/log resources, process shutdown and rejected-file preservation.
- Removed duplicate theme bootstraps, obsolete stylesheet helpers and unused job cancellation APIs;
  shared browser timeline mapping and enabled unused TypeScript symbol checks.
- CI covers build, formatting, unit/integration tests, browser workflows and a Compose health check.
- Updated Fastify and fast-uri; production dependency audit reports no known vulnerabilities at
  verification time. Related upstream advisories:
  [Fastify](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w2qp-rph6-63g4) and
  [fast-uri](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8).

### Upgrade notes

Stop the service and make a full-data backup before upgrading. Explicitly preserve your existing
`DASHCAM_DATA_DIR`: the native default changed from `/mnt/data/dashcam` to project-local `data/`.
New database columns migrate automatically; rollback requires the matching pre-upgrade backup.
Legacy clips without immutable capture timestamps need manual verification. Existing custom UI
strings remain operator-owned. See [operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md) for concurrency setting changes.

One service process and local storage are required. Server restart marks unfinished work interrupted;
it does not resume an encoder at the previous frame. Automatic codec conversion, arbitrary camera
filename guessing, distributed queues and backup path relocation remain outside this release.
